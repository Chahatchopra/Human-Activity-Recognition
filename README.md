# Human-Activity-Recognition
This repository presents an implementation of Human Activity Recognition (HAR) employing both Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Long-term Recurrent Convolutional Networks (LRCN) models. The aim is to classify human activities based on sequential sensor data, such as accelerometer and gyroscope readings. The project includes preprocessing steps to normalize and handle missing data, followed by the construction and training of the LSTM and LRCN architectures using popular deep learning framework that is TensorFlow. Users can evaluate the models' performance using standard metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on a held-out validation set or through cross-validation.
